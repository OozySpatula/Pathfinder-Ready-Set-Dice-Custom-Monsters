Attempt a Crafting check (DC13)\nCritical Success Your gizmos go into a state of incredible efficiency called critical overdrive, adding great power to your attacks. Your Strikes deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or reset, and you can't use Overdrive for 1 minute.\nSuccess Your gizmos go into overdrive, adding power to your attacks. As critical success, except the additional damage is equal to half your Intelligence modifier.\nFailure You make a miscalculation and nothing happens.\nCritical Failure Whoops! Something explodes. You take fire damage equal to your level, and you can't use Overdrive again for 1 minute as your gizmos cool down and reset. \nSpecial When under the effects of Overdrive, you can still use the Overdrive action. You can't extend your Overdrive's duration this way, but you can turn an overdrive into a critical overdrive if you critically succeed. A failure has no effect on your current Overdrive, and you end your Overdrive on a critical failure."},{"id":"_91d1q0a8few","name":"Explosive Mine (1)","traits":"consumable, gadget","range":"","actions":"one","type":"offense","description":"When you Activate an explosive mine, you place it on the ground in a square within your reach, priming it to explode when a creature steps on that square. If you have time in advance to prepare, you can place the mine on the ground before activating it, and you or an ally can try to use Stealth to Conceal an Object before you Activate the mine. If you don't Conceal the mine, its position is obvious at a glance.\n\nOnce activated, the mine is primed to explode when enough pressure is placed on the square where it's located. Typically, this occurs when a Small or larger creature moves onto the square, though it could happen if a creature intentionally places pressure on the square from a distance to safely trigger the mine. Once triggered, the mine explodes, dealing 2d6 fire damage in a 5-foot emanation with a basic Reflex save DC15."},{"id":"_e3ag4kvo8q","name":"Cryomister (2)","traits":"cold, consumable, gadget","range":"","actions":"one","type":"offense","description":"When you Activate a cryomister, you can either place it in an adjacent square or toss it up to 20 feet away. Once you've done so, the metallic device instantly disperses a heavy mist, settling quickly on nearby flat surfaces and forming a sheet of ice. The cryomister creates a burst with a 5ft radius, making the affected area difficult terrain for 1 minute. If an affected square takes fire damage, the difficult terrain is removed. Though not designed as a weapon, the cryomister's rapidly cooling mist deals cold splash damage depending on the type to creatures in the area on activation. Creatures attempting to move through the affected area can attempt an Acrobatics check with a DC17, and the cold splash damage is 1. The floating ice can support one creature up to Medium size.to ignore the difficult terrain and move at their normal Speed. Throwing the cryomister onto the surface of a liquid creates a floating piece of ice for the same duration, capable of supporting one or more creatures of the listed size."}],"morespells":[],"alignment":"le","size":"small","type":"humanoid","adjust":0,"description":"","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"25 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":"1","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"3","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"0","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"3","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"1","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"-1","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":3,"benchmark":"moderate","note":"darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"16","benchmark":"moderate","note":"Ablative Armour"},"hp":{"value":"13","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"4","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"7","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":"3","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_1pytwva1mwk","name":"repeating hand crossbow","traits":"repeating, 60ft","attack":"+6","damage":"1d6+3","type":"Ranged"},{"id":"_2muay0aks2i","name":"Bayonet","traits":"","attack":"+8","damage":" 1d4+1 piercing","type":"Melee"}],"languages":"Draconic"}
